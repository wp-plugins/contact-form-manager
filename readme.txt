First you need to create a new contact form. Now in the XYZ Contact > Contact Forms page you can see the newly created contact form and its short code. Please copy this short code and paste in your contact page.

To add a new field in the contact form, please click the edit contact form or add a new contact form link. Now you can see a section Form Elements and from here please select the Add Elements. No you can select the and create a new element or field.

= 4. Should I replace my contact form shortcode after editing the contact form element settings ? =

No. There is no need to replace the contact form shortcode after editing the contact form elements. It will update automatically and saves you from the trouble of replacing the code everytime.


= 5. How should I get a mail with all the fields used in the contact form ? =

In the mail content, please use all the codes corresponding to the fields you have used in the contact field. Please make sure that you have added all the tag codes (the code will be like [text-1], [email-2] etc.) in the email body. Custom fields like captcha and submit button cannot be used in mail.


= 6. Can I embed the contact form into my template file ? =


Yes, you can embed the contact form into your template file. You cannot directly add the shortcode in the template file but you will need to pass the code into do_shortcode() function and display its output like this:

<?php echo do_shortcode( '[xyz-cfm-form id=1]' ); ?>


= 7. I want to use contact form in my language, not in English. How can I do that ? =

For changing language, please check the [how-to-change-the-language-in-contact-form-manager](http://docs.xyzscripts.com/contact-form-manager/how-to-change-the-language-in-contact-form-manager/ "Contact Form Manager Documentation - Changing Language") section in our docs.


= 8. CAPTCHA does not work =

We are using 2 types of captcha in the contact form

    Simple image verification

    Recaptcha

If you are using the standard captcha, you need GD and FreeType library installed on your server.

If you are using the recaptcha, please make sure that you have configured the public key and private key.


= 9. Site Admin is not receiving any mail using the contact form =


While editing the 'Mail to site admin' section of a contact form, you need to specify the 'from email' address. Since you want the message from your visitor's email id, we are using the code of the user email here. The code is something like [email-2].

But in some servers, they don't allow to send emails with from addresses that are outside the server domain. So in such conditions, you need to add your own email address with the same domain extension of your server in the 'from email' section.
